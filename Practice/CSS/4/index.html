    <p class="first"><b>Could you give an example of what is expected in Question 1 part (a) and part (b) of Paper 1? In part (a), the question asks candidates to describe the major theme they can detect in the passage they have chosen.</b> Thus, if they were asked about Sura 112, which the syllabus lists under the major theme (1) Allah in himself, they would write about the theme of the oneness of God (though in more detail). In different parts of the Qur'an, these themes are talked about slightly differently – thus, while Sura 112 talks about the oneness of God in one way, Sura 2.255 talks about it in a slightly different way, using different language and creating different pictures in the mind. In part (b), therefore, the question asks candidates to explain the particular features of the description in the chosen passage. They may refer to the concepts included in Sura 112 – e.g. not begetting and not being begotten, as opposed to Sura 2.255, e.g. not being comprehended by human thought, never sleeping and being seated on the throne. So the question as a whole tests candidates' knowledge of (a) the main teaching in a passage, and also (b) their understanding of the way in which that particular passage conveys the teaching. </p>

    <p class="second">It appears from the syllabus that moral matters – such as modesty, self- respect, respect for women, finance, relations with non-Muslims, and Islam in community life – are no longer separate topics but have been merged with topics such as the biography of the Prophet. Is this correct? Yes, it is true that in the syllabus there is no separate topic on 'moral' matters, as these have been merged with other topics. If you look closely at the syllabus, you will see that issues of morality are now linked with study of the Qur'an, the Hadiths, the Prophet and the Caliphs. Even in the old syllabus, questions on morality - Question 3 in 2058/02 - have nearly always been worded as 'Describe three examples from the life of the Prophet that show how he treated his wives', or something similar. The intention has been to get candidates to link the example of the Prophet or the teaching of the Qur'an or the example of the Caliphs with issues of morality. So the revised syllabus simply makes this link explicit.  </p>
