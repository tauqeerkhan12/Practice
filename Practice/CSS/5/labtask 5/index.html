    <p class="all pone">When you use relative, fixed, or
absolute positioning, boxes can
overlap. If boxes do overlap, the
elements that appear later in the
HTML code sit on top of those
that are earlier in the page.
If you want to control which
element sits on top, you can use
the z-index property. Its value
is a number, and the higher the
number the closer that element
is to the front. For example, an
element with a z-index of 10
will appear over the top of one
with a z-index of 5.
