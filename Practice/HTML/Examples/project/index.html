    <p class="all pone">(this is acting text)When you use relative, fixed, or
                            absolute positioning, boxes can
                            overlap. If boxes do overlap, the
                            elements that appear later in the
                            HTML code sit on top of those
                            that are earlier in the page.
                            If you want to control which
                            element sits on top, you can use
                            the z-index property. Its value
                            is a number, and the higher the
                            number the closer that element
                            is to the front. For example, an
                            element with a z-index of 10
                            will appear over the top of one
                            with a z-index of 5.

                        Those that would have the same effect on text no matter  ● what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)
